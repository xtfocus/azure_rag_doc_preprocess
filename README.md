# Azure naive ingestion pipeline for image and text retrieval

A dual-indexing system

todo:

Indexing:
- extract_texts_and_images takes too long for some reason. need checks
- add contexts to image description


Retrieval (in my other repo):
- add image to selected context chunks
- file summary as the first retrieval round
