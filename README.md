# Azure naive ingestion pipeline for image and text retrieval

A dual-indexing system

todo:

Indexing:
- extract_texts_and_images takes too long for some reason. need checks
- add summary image description before embedding
- Recognize complex pages and handle them like a total image.


Retrieval (in my other repo):
- [x] add image to selected context chunks
- [x] file summary as the first retrieval round
