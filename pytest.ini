# This is the main configuration file for pytest
# It defines how pytest should behave when running tests in this project

[pytest]
# Add the project root directory to the Python path
# Using "." instead of "src" allows Python to find any package in the project directory
# This enables imports like "from src.file_utils import ..." which matches the project structure
# It's more flexible for future additions of other packages alongside 'src'
pythonpath = .

# Specify where pytest should look for test files
# In this case, all tests are in the tests/ directory
testpaths = tests

# Define patterns for test discovery:
# Only consider files that start with "test_" as test files
python_files = test_*.py

# Only consider classes that start with "Test" as test classes
python_classes = Test

# Only consider functions that start with "test_" as test functions
python_functions = test_*

# Default command line options for pytest:
# -v: verbose output (shows more detail about test execution)
# -ra: show extra test summary info about (a)ll tests except passed
# -q: less verbose output (reduces clutter)
addopts = -v -ra -q
